I wanted to speedrun a microcontroller in EasyEDA... so I did just that! I began with picking the MCU. The Attiny85 is outdated and doesn't have all the flashiest features, but is good enough for basic use and is quite cheap ($1.50 per). I began the schematic. Pretty simple, as I've worked with the attiny85 before. I did have to use some diodes and power protection circuitry. After an hour, I got this:

Then I began work on the PCB. I haven't really made anything this small before, so layout was interesting. I just put the capacitors near the power pins. Their weren't too many. I got an inital prototype, but then someone wanted me to add a ground plane. Then someone told me to add a keychain hole, so I did. Then that person told me to make the hole a semicircle. Then someone offered to buy the PCB as a keychain for $10 lol. Okay but I got this after everything:
